    <p>The golden doodle is a low- to non-shedding breed, however to prevent matting you need to brush them as often as possible. A golden doodleâ€™s coat also requires professional grooming regularly. With their adorable appearance, even temperaments, good health and hypoallergenic coats they are not only the perfect family pets, they are also the most popular designer dogs today.</p>

    <p>These dog breeds are also very easy to train, caring, intuitive and they thrive on social interaction. Always smiling, the golden doodles have a remarkable zest for life and a slight bounce in their step. This therefore makes them an excellent guide dog or therapy dog.</p></b></big>
