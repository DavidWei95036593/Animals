   <p>
     <big><li>These are a relatively new type of dog and have been around since the late 1990’s. The term “Teddy Bear” is most commonly used in descriptions of a cross-breed between a Shih Tzu and a Bichon Frise. However, it has also been used to describe different hybrids between breeds like: Schnauzers, Shih Tzu, Cocker Spaniels, Toy Poodles, Bichon Frise, Daschunds and Yorkshire Terriers. The Zuchon, Tzu Frise or Shichon has gained the name "Teddy Bear" because of its general resemblance to a stuffed teddy bear, its fluffy coat, small size, large eyes and delicate features. Teddy-bear puppies are extremely loyal pets and really love physical contact. For this reason, it is not unusual for your teddy bear puppy to take a mid-day nap at your feet or on your lap. What’s more they don’t typically bark unless when someone new enters the house for the first time or when they feel there is danger around the house. Additionally, they are soft and cuddly, but they don’t shed much or in most cases, at all. They are also bred not to produce too much dander, a very common allergen. Therefore, most teddy-bear puppies are hypo-allergenic making them ideal for anyone with allergies.</li></big>
